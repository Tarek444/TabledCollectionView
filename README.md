# TabledSectionsTest

I want the CollectionViews inside the TableViewCells to use a background color according to their belonging section, but I don’t know
how and I am really struggling with it. Using the storyboard with
different prototype cells is pretty important to me since I have many
different cells and am not that good at coding as you can see.
